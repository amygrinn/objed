                           INTRODUCTION

**********************************************************************

Objed is a global minor-mode to navigate and edit text
objects. Objed enables modal editing and composition of commands,
too. It combines ideas of other Editors like Vim or Kakoune and
tries to align them with regular Emacs conventions.

For more information also see:

- My Blog: https://www.with-emacs.com/categories/objed/
- Project Readme: https://github.com/clemera/objed/blob/master/README.asc
- Project News: https://github.com/clemera/objed/blob/master/News.asc.

Text objects are textual patterns like a line, a top level
definition, a word, a sentence or any other unit of text. When
objed-mode or objed-local-mode is enabled, certain editing
commands (configurable) will activate objed and enable its modal
editing features. When active, keys which would usually insert a
character are mapped to objed commands. Other keys and commands
will continue to work as they normally would and exit this
editing state again.


>> Type \\[keyboard-quit] in order to activate objed, choosing
   the initial object based on `last-command' and
   `objed-cmd-alist'

>> Type \\[keyboard-quit] again to quit objed mode

                       ENTERING OBJED MODE

**********************************************************************

When you type \\[keyboard-quit], notice that objed shows the
current object type in the `mode-line'. The textual content of
the object is highlighted visually in the buffer and the cursor
color is changed, too.

\\[keyboard-quit] is not the only way to enter
`objed-mode'. Most other text movement commands also activate
objed with the relevant object type.

>> Type \\[forward-word] to move the cursor forward a single word
   and activate `objed-mode' with the `word' object type

>> Type \\[next-line] to move the cursor forward a single line
   and activate `objed-mode' with the `line' object type

>> Type \\[beginning-of-buffer] to move the cursor to the
   beginning of the buffer and activate `objed-mode' with the
   `buffer' object type.

>> Type \\[right-char] to move the cursor forward a single
   character and activate `objed-mode' with the `char' object
   type

>> Type \\[forward-sexp] to move the cursor forward to the next
   s-expression and activate `objed-mode' with the `sexp' object
   type

Once objed is activated, you can change the object type by using
a standard movement key.

delimiters or padding around an object is excluded.

The following commands can be used to modify the state of a
selected object:

- \\[objed-expand-context] `objed-expand-context'

  Activate the inner part of the object at point and move to the
  start. This is useful to act on the content of the string,
  brackets and so on. On repeat expand to other objects around
  current position

  Toggle object state. Switches between inner and whole object
  state

**********************************************************************

                       SWITCH OBJECT TYPES (Avy)

**********************************************************************

Another way to switch object types is by using one of three
prefix keys, followed by the single letter identifier of the
object type to switch to. Here is a list of all the available
object types:

\\{objed-object-map}

The prefix keys are as follows.

- " (propertize "o" 'font-lock-face 'help-key-binding) "

  Switch to the nearest instance of the type selected.

  For example, press " (propertize "o l" 'font-lock-face 'help-key-binding) "
  to switch to the line object type selecting the current line.

- " (propertize "#" 'font-lock-face 'help-key-binding) "

  Switch to another object using `avy'.

  This is similar to " (propertize "c" 'font-lock-face 'help-key-binding) "
  except instead of selecting the nearest textual object, it will
  use `avy' to select any object instance in the visible portion
  of the buffer.

- " (propertize "=" 'font-lock-face 'help-key-binding) "

  Switch to another object inside the current one using `avy'.

  This is similar to " (propertize "#" 'font-lock-face 'help-key-binding) "
  except instead of allowing you to select any object in the
  visible portion of the buffer, it will restrict `avy' to find
  instances within the currently selected object.
